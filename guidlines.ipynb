Guidelines for Prompting
In this lesson, you'll practice two prompting principles and their related tactics in order to write effective prompts for large language models.

Setup
Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.
In this course, we've provided some code that loads the OpenAI API key for you.

import openai
import os
​
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
​
openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
helper function
Throughout this course, we will use OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model and the chat completions endpoint.

This helper function will make it easier to use prompts and look at the generated outputs:

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
Prompting Principles
Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
Tactics
Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, <tag> </tag>, :
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
Clear and specific instructions should be provided to guide a model towards the desired output, and longer prompts can provide more clarity and context for the model, leading to more detailed and relevant outputs.
Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
JSON, HTML
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
[
  {
    "book_id": 1,
    "title": "The Lost City of Zorath",
    "author": "Aria Blackwood",
    "genre": "Fantasy"
  },

    "book_id": 2,
    "title": "The Last Survivors",

  {
    "book_id": 3,
    "title": "The Secret of the Haunted Mansion",
    "author": "Lila Rose",
    "genre": "Mystery"
  }
]
Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied
text_1 = f"""
Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \ 
water boiling. While that's happening, \ 
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \ 
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \ 
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \ 
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \ 
cup of tea to enjoy.

Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.
​
<child>: Teach me about patience.
​
<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
<grandparent>: Resilience is like a tree that bends with the wind but never breaks. It is the ability to bounce back from adversity and keep moving forward, even when things get tough. Just like a tree that grows stronger with each storm it weathers, resilience is a quality that can be developed and strengthened over time.

​
As an AI language model, I don't have information about the future job market in 2023. However, here are some general tips that may help you in your job search as a 2-year experienced developer:

1. Keep your skills up-to-date: Technology is constantly evolving, and it's important to stay current with the latest trends and tools in your field. Attend conferences, take online courses, and participate in coding challenges to keep your skills sharp.

2. Build a strong portfolio: Showcase your work by creating a portfolio of your projects. This will help potential employers see your skills in action and give them a better idea of what you can bring to the table.

3. Network: Attend industry events, join online communities, and connect with other developers in your field. This can help you learn about job opportunities and get referrals from people you know.

4. Apply for jobs that match your skills and experience: Look for job postings that match your skills and experience level. Don't waste your time applying for jobs that require more experience than you have.

5. Prepare for interviews: Practice your coding skills, research the company you're interviewing with, and be prepared to answer common interview questions. This will help you make a good impression and increase your chances of getting hired.
Notes on using the OpenAI API outside of this classroom
To install the OpenAI Python library:

!pip install openai
The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available on the website.

You can either set it as the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable before using the library:

 !export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
Or, set openai.api_key to its value:

import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-..."
A note about the backslash
In the course, we are using a backslash \ to make the text fit on the screen without inserting newline '\n' characters.
GPT-3 isn't really affected whether you insert newline characters or not. But when working with LLMs in general, you may consider whether newline characters in your prompt may affect the model's performance.
