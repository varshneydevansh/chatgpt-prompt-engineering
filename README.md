# chatgpt-prompt-engineering
Jupyter code notebooks of "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" by DeepLearning.AI and OpenAI.


## After many days I am again doing my hands dirty with AI/ML and from past 4 months I have been working closely on OpenAi's GPT model.

This course is presented by one of my favourite professor Andrew Ng.

Here, in this short course taught by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) they will describe how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, and show how LLM APIs can be used in applications for a variety of tasks, including:

1. Summarizing (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)
2. Inferring (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)
3. Transforming text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)
4. Expanding (e.g., automatically writing emails)
